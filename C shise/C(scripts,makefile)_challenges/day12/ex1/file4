Cat Linux control: Use and examples

The Linux cat command is one of the most useful commands you can learn. It takes its name from the word concatenate and allows you to create, merge or print files in the standard result screen or to another file and much more.

It does not require any installation since it is pre-installed with the coreutile package in any system based on Debian or Red Hat.
